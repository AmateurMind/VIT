# Track 2: AI and Automation in Blockchain

## Enhance campus trust and coordination using verifiable, privacy-preserving blockchain automation.

## The Challenge
**AI and Automation in Blockchain**

Campus systems such as voting, attendance tracking, feedback collection, certification, and group coordination often suffer from lack of trust, manual verification, data tampering, and privacy concerns. Centralized systems require users to trust authorities while offering little transparency or auditability.

The challenge is to build beginner-friendly blockchain applications on Algorand that improve trust, verification, and coordination for campus activities. Solutions should demonstrate how blockchain can enable fair participation, verifiable records, privacy-preserving systems, and simple automation without relying on centralized control.

**Alignment:**
This project addresses this challenge by using Algorand for the immutable trust layer (Voing, Attendance, Verification) and n8n/Telegram for simple, non-controlling automation.
